# WishingTree

WishingTree ~is~ *will be* an open source course platform.

This project is in early stages and this currently stands as some thoughts/prototypes of early MVP features.

## Getting Started (IntelliJ IDEA)

- Create a repo from this template/pull it down
- Run `scala-cli setup-ide src` in the root folder
- Open up the project in IntelliJ IDEA, and it should tell you that it detected a BSP module.
- Open up the module settings, and import the BSP module.

# Samara

This is a simple project template to get you started making things
with [branch](https://github.com/wishingtreedev/branch).

## Getting Started (IntelliJ IDEA)

- Create a repo from this template/pull it down
- Run `scala-cli setup-ide src` in the root folder
- Open up the project in IntelliJ IDEA, and it should tell you that it detected a BSP module.
- Open up the module settings, and import the BSP module.

## GitHub Actions

There is a `pr-tests.yaml` file in the `.github/workflows` folder that runs the tests on PRs to the `main` branch.
